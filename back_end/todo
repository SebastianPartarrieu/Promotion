- add functionnality to delete your own account, for client and commerce
- refresh tokens
- leverage refresh tokens to ask users to reidentify themselves before deleting their account
- constraints on min amount of characters for passwords
- add admin functionnalities (checking images but also deleting promotion and commerce)


- convert address when inputed to latitude and longitude
- change way images are sent to FE client
